# vanilla-vite-template

## Description

This is a template for a vanilla JS project using Vite. It includes the following:

- [x] [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [x] [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [x] [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Requirements

- [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Usage

### Project setup

```
pnpm i
```

Here and throughout the project we are using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager.
You can also use `npm` or `yarn` if you prefer.

If you are using `npm` or `yarn` you will need to remove `pnpm-lock.json` before running `npm i` or `yarn`.
